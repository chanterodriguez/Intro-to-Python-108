#  MINI CHALLENGE: THE TRAVEL BAG
# -------------------------------
# You’re packing for a trip! You have a tuple that stores the items you’re taking.

# 1. Create a tuple called "travel_bag" with at least 5 items (e.g. "shirt", "toothbrush", etc.)
# 2. Print the SECOND and FOURTH items in your bag.
# 3. Check if "shoes" is in your travel bag — if it is, print "You're ready to walk!"
#     otherwise, print "You forgot your shoes!"
# 4. Make a new tuple called "essentials" with 3 must-have items.
# 5. Combine both tuples into one called "final_bag".
# 6. Print how many total items you now have using len().
# 7. Print the last item in your "final_bag".

print("Second item:", travel_bag[1])

    print("You're ready to walk!")

essentials = ("passport", "wallet", "medication")

print(final_bag)

print("Total items:", len(final_bag))
